## 🎯 Spanning Tree :

A weighted graph will be given and we have to find the minimum weighted spanning tree. 

🌟🌟 2 Algorithms for Minimum Spanning tree: 
  - Kruskal's Algorithm
    - First there will be an empty set
    - Choose minimum vertex until there is no cycle
    - put all the vertex in a set
    - sort based on the edges
    - make set for each edge - vertex
    - merge the vertex
