What is Program? 
- Set of ordered instructions.
- A computer program is a ways to tell a computer what to do.
- A computer program is a list of ordered instructions --- that we write using a programming language that the computer understands. 

### What is Algorithm:

A computational procedure that takes 
- some value , or set of values , as input 
- Algorithm are the systematic ordered logical approach which is a well defined, step-by-step procedure that allows a computer to solve a problem.
- Algorithm must  :
	-  it must produce the correct result 
	-  it must finish in some finite time

Example : 

|   Problem	    | Input	                          |Output                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Check if the number is prime|A number            |'YES'/'NO'            |
|Finding the shortest path between two position |"MAP" / Location 1/ Location 2            |"Get the time"            |


### Linear Search Algorithm
1. Start from leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[].
2. if x matches with an element, return the index.
3. If x doesn't match with any of elements, return -1.

	 
> **Note:** The **Pseudo code** is closer to human language but . English>Pseudo-code>real programming language changes with processions.
